# STR-density
Scripts and background to determine short tandem repeat (STR) densities in genes and genomes

## Background  

Short tandem repeats (STRs) are consecutive repetitions of 1-6 basepair (bp) motifs. They are estimated to make up around 3% of the human genome. Below is an example STR locus:

STRs are a rich source of genomic variation, with some loci having mutation rates up to a 10000 times higher than point mutations. STR mutations are typically the result of DNA polymerase slippage during replication, where strand misalignment after polymerase detachment results in the insertion or deletion of one or more repeat units at an STR locus:

For more background on STRs, the way they mutate, and why they are relevant, you can have a look at our recent review: [Mutation and selection processes regulating short tandem repeats give rise to genetic and phenotypic diversity across species](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jeb.14106) (there's also a pdf in the [literature](literature) folder).
